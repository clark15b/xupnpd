<div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p>
I’m an author and developer of the following open source projects:
tsdemuxer, ps3muxer, pshare and luasp.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Since 2011, I
have been developing an extendable DLNA media server for home routers
with multicast IPTV support. The program is distributed by GPL2
license in the original scripts and is included in the official
repository of OpenWRT.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
Taking into consideration the current needs of my program users, for
several months I have been developing a next-generation home media
server - xupnpd2.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Xupnpd2 is a complete cross-platform media server
with the ability to broadcast IPTV and OTT into local network, as
well as video, photos and music from the home archive to any a
DLNA-compatible device.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Key features:</p>
<p>
<span><b>1.
The online TV and video playback on the game consoles </b>PlayStation
3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, SmartTV and other different devices.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>2. Multiple platforms support: </b>Microsoft
Windows 7/8/10, Mac OS X 10.5.8 or higher, different
installation packages of GNU Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
embedded systems based on OpenWRT and DD-WRT.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>3. Low
system requirements.</b>
Software code is written entirely in C++, and there is almost no
dependence on the external libraries. This, in turn, led to a record
small size of the program with high functionality, performance, and
portability.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>4.
Intuitively understandable user interface.</b>
At this time there is no need to search answers on the Internet since
the new version will have an intuitively-understandable,
user-friendly interface, and the preparation for the work will take
only few minutes. The user doesn’t need to have any special
computer skills, all the user needs to do is to relax and enjoy
watching favorite television programs in the original quality.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><br></h3>
<h3>What is already available</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>At this stage,
there is already a working version for Microsoft Windows, GNU
Linux, FreeBSD and OpenWRT with online streaming, and it has the
functionality of a full-rate media server that supports Lua scripts, the extensions and HLS.</br></br>

<a href="/files/xupnpd2-embed.tar.gz">xupnpd2-embed.tar.gz</a> (2018-07-20)<br><br>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I carried on
the testing of Windows, Linux and OpenWRT versions on: the LG TV, PlayStation
3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, media player Iconbit, Windows Media
Player and VLC.</p>
<p>
The process of
implementing in Mac OS X is in progress.</p>
<p>
At this point
the software package for GNU Linux takes only 270K, for Microsoft
Windows - 1.5M, and for OpenWRT - 300K.</p>
<br><p></p>
<p></p>

<p>
The next
planned stage is the implementation of the support for OMDB for skins
downloading and video titles from home collection, SoundCloud, and so on. There will be a
possibility for FTP access to the collection and user-friendly
Web-based interface with a minimal set of settings for a device
control, the possibility to watch video in browser with a help of
HTML5 tools on the compatible devices, including the Nintendo Wii U.
There will be Android and iOS apps to control the watching process,
and also the media -server version for Mac OS X. In the future
prospect, we want to achieve compatibility with the Chromecast and
Apple TV. And this is not the limit, the structure of the program
allows to extend easily its functionality and to add new sources of
media content, and I have a lot more ideas.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
People all
over the world, especially not in very prosperous regions, want to
have access to the information.</p>
<p>
The purpose of
this project is to give people the ability to watch movies and TV in
high quality using network and with no additional cost, using the
equipment they already have. Thanks to xupnpd2 they don’t have to
buy a satellite dish and set-top boxes (Set-Top Box), they are free
to choose any provider the will pay to for the access to the content
or not to pay at all, limiting themselves with the free network
broadcasts.</p>

<h3>A little bit more about myself and my plans</h3><p></p><p>
</p><p>
I am fond of programming from the early childhood.
I began to study architecture of ZX Spectrum and programming for it
on Basic. I know such programming languages as: C / C++, Lua,
Assembler, Pascal and Java. I have programming experience in C++
since 1996. Professionally I have been developing software since
2001. From about 2003 I’m working with network technologies and
participating in the software development for highly loaded
distributed systems controlled by GNU Linux and FreeBSD.</p>
<p>
The first open source project started in 2009 as a
program for personal use, but I felt sorry for hiding the results of
the work from the world and I decided to share them for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
The current project is xupnpd. I have been working
on it alone since 2011 to the present. It is a home media server with
support for multicast IPTV, and the system of extensions in Lua
language, that is included into official repository of the operating
system for OpenWRT routers.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YomT03aNvro"></iframe></p>
<p>
My program works on most routers, NAS-es, directly
on some SmartTV, the DreamBox satellite receivers, computers running
under GNU Linux and FreeBSD, and even on the Raspberry PI.</p>
<p>
It is compatible with many UPnP / DLNA-compatible
devices, such as: SmartTV of different manufacturers, PlayStation
3/4, Xbox One, smartphones, Microsoft Windows Media Player and
VideoLAN.</p>
<p>
With the help of xupnpd it is possible to playback
directly from your TV or high-definition IPTV game console of your
ISP without turning on your computer or any other content providers
on the nework.</p>
<p>
If you wish you could watch your own video from
home archive or through the use of system extensions you could turn
to online resources such as YouTube, Vimeo, GameTrailers, Giant Bomb,
IVI and Vkontakte.</p>
<p>
With a help of xupnpd it became possible to
discard the lease or purchase of set-top box in order to watch
digital TV at home. The program is written in C++ and the Lua, it
takes up little space, and it is able to work on many Posix systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Taking into consideration the current trends, I
have decided to review the functionality and get rid of the old code.
I also designed xupnpd2 on the basis of the mandatory requirements of
its native version on Microsoft Windows 7/8/10 (without Cygwin), Mac
OS X 10.5.8 or higher (Intel / PPC) , different GNU Linux packages,
FreeBSD and NetBSD and possibly OpenBSD. The embedded systems won’t
be neglected based on OpenWRT and DD-WRT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
In order to improve the performance, almost all of
the program core code was written in C++, the ability to write
custom Lua-scripts was retained, SQLite support appeared and the
possibility to build extensions (filters) in the chain for multistep
conversion of online video was added. Due to these facts the optional
transcoding or another stream modification in real time can appear in
future, and for example, the organization of the home surveillance
video system can appear as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Now xupnpd2 is a complete cross-platform media
server with the ability to broadcast to the local network without
transcoding video, photos and music from your home archive to any
DLNA-compatible device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
At this time, many players’ features were taken
into account and now it supports: rewind, pause, move to any moment
and resume watching on SmartTV, gaming consoles, PlayStation 3,
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
The user manual will appear in different
languages, as well as the FAQ on the program website. Advanced users,
as before, will be able to create their own extensions to tune the
behavior of the program when broadcasting the digital television to
the home network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
There is a record small size of the program with
its high functionality, portability, absence of the need for the
program mandatory installation on the computer's hard drive as well
as the absence of a mandatory subscription for investors for the
program usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
After xupnpd2 release it will retain the
possibility of basic functions free use with some restrictions but
unlike its predecessor it will stop being an open source project and
it will become proprietary software.</p><p><br></p><p></p><h3>Previous projects</h3><p>
    
    
    
</p><p><b>
luasp</b> (2011)  is Web programming language with
support of MySQL, CURL and JSON on Lua-based for embedded systems. It
was created for personal needs, with the following publication of
original scripts under the BSD license.</p>
<p>
GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/clark15b/luasp">https://github.com/clark15b/luasp</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>
pshare</b> (2010) is the first attempt to develop a
miniature DLNA compatible media server for personal use, which
allowed me to watch the Extreme Sports Channel in high quality on the
Sony PlayStation 3 without having to turn on the computer. Later I
published the original program codes and provided the community with
ready binaries for several models of home WiFi router running under
OpenWRT or DD-WRT. The program was notable for minimal consumption of
resources and worked without any problems on weak D-Link DIR-320.</p>
<p>
The program became a prototype for more functional
open source xupnpd product creation. Distributed by GPL2 license.</p>
